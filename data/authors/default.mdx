VinhChilling (fullname Vinh Pham Ngoc Thanh) is an undergraduate at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). My main interest is **Cybersecurity**, mostly web recon and exploits, but I'm also learning lower level pwn and re as well. 

The biggest extracular commitment at Purdue of mine is [B01lers](https://b01lers.com/), where we play CTFs, compete in bigger [Competitions](https://ectfmitre.gitlab.io/ectf-website/index.html), do [CTF developements](https://ctftime.org/event/2250) and more.

I work on projects that focus on making web recon and exploiting more seamless, so the main effort is not figuring out the right flags for a tool, where to find and how to parse output, etc; but rather seeing the bigger picture and CTF-like problem-solving. For Summer 2024 this would be on my [Google Summer of Code Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/tN4HyoGJ)

In terms of research, I'm working on **Open-Source's Security** (Static and Dynamic Analysis). Again, just making sure low-hanging fruits get caught fast for efforts to be on bigger things.

On the more human side, I love doing wild stuff and travel. Anything providing an adrenaline rush works.
